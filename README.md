# Face-Detection
Face detection identifies faces in images or video using AI, while video capture streams real-time frames from a camera. Together, they enable real-time face tracking for use in surveillance, attendance, authentication, and interactive systems.
# Real-Time Face Detection Using OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project implements a **real-time face detection system** using Python and OpenCV. It captures live video from your webcam, detects faces using Haar Cascade classifiers, and highlights detected faces with bounding boxes.

## Features
- Real-time face detection on webcam video feed  
- Uses OpenCVâ€™s pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for frontal face detection  
- Draws rectangles around detected faces for clear visualization  
- Easy to run and modify for further enhancements

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammadmazharuddin/Face-Detection.git
